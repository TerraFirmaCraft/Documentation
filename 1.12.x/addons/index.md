This section is rather empty, as in most cases, the best way to find API hooks for things is to:

- Look at how TFC itself handles something
- Read the Javadoc
- Ask about specific API hooks in our discord

We cannot cover every possible use case, so if there are things that you believe are missing, please let us know and we'll see what we can do.

That said, TFC has one major *unconventional* system which is used by addons to add Metals, Ores, Trees, Rocks, etc. This is the system of [Pre-Block Registry Types](registry-types/)
